# Raytrace2

This is the first continuation of the ray tracer.
To incorporate lighting, we’ll need to define a few more variables in the config file (see config1.txt for specifics).
-	Eye point is going to be at 0,0,0
-	Ka and Kd need to be defined
-	Lights will be defined in the same way as spheres:
o	First line: LIGHTS: n
	Where n is the number of lights
o	Followed by (for each light)
	LIGHT: x y z
      COLOR: r g b
config1.txt gives the input file, and out.wmv shows what you should be seeing as output
